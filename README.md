# UFC Data Analysis

This project is an iterative attempt to predict the winner of UFC fights. The main focus will be developing my data analysis skills using tools with which I am less familiar.

## Dataset

This project will utilize the 'Ultimate UFC Dataset' found [here on Kaggle.](https://www.kaggle.com/mdabbert/ultimate-ufc-dataset) I have also created a data dictionary to better describe some of the header names in the dataset. The data dictionary is in this repo, [and here is a link.](https://github.com/moferg/ufc/blob/main/data-dictionary.csv)
